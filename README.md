# CMN-C1-079 — Multilingual Customer Service Intent Classification & Routing Agent

> **Category**: Cat 1 (delivers a single technical capability, generic and use-case-agnostic)
> **Industry**: CMN (common / cross-industry)

## Overview

Classifies customer service intent and routes requests across multiple languages
(ja/en/zh/ko/vi/th). Detects language, scores urgency, classifies intent, and decides
routing for customer-facing support workflows. An optional operator-tuned request mode
lets an INTERNAL caller customise routing rules, intent taxonomy, or confidence
thresholds.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |
| Azure OpenAI | A resource with a deployment — `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design spec and test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
